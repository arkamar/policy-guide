Removing stable keywords

:Reported: n/a

Stable keywords (or the last stable version) can be removed from
a package if the relevant arch team does not respond within 90 days.
If the removal causes a breakage of dependency graph, the developer
must work with maintainers of the depending packages before proceeding
with it.

The policy for removing a package must be followed here, with exception
of last rite mails.
